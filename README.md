SeSAMe is an R package for processing Infinium DNA methylation data. SeSAMe currently supports EPIC, HM450 and HM27 platforms and dynamically generated manifest.

To install from Github,
```R
BiocManager::install("zwdzwd/sesame")
```

See the package [Home Page on Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sesame.html) and the [Developmental Branch](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/sesame.html).

It also has a depended [data package](https://github.com/zwdzwd/sesameData) for annotation and example data.
